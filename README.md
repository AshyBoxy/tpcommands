# TPCommands
This is just a small server only mod that providing some teleportation commands

Right now this is just /spawn and /home (and /sethome) but I might add more later

I made this for a private minecraft server, ahead of time for 1.21's full release

## Config
The default configuration used when creating a new world cannot be changed

After starting a server, you can use /tpconfig to change the settings, autocomplete will help you with the setting names

The cooldowns are set in seconds, and the delays in ticks

If you set shareCooldowns, then /spawn and /home cooldown's will stop you from using the other. I'd recommend you set their cooldowns to the same amount of seconds

## Translating
See `src/main/resources/assets/tpcommands/lang/en_us.json` for an example
